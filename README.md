# Cancer-Data-Patient-Management

# Overview
This project focuses on developing a Cancer Patient Data Management System that centralizes patient medical histories, treatment plans, outcomes, and more to streamline the management of cancer patient care. The system is designed to improve the coordination between healthcare providers, optimize treatment monitoring, and provide comprehensive analytics for data-driven decisions.

The project involves implementing both relational (MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases to handle cancer patient data and utilizes Python for synthetic data generation and RStudio for data visualization and analysis. The goal is to offer a scalable and efficient solution that enhances patient outcomes and ensures better resource allocation in healthcare settings.

# Features
Centralized Patient Database: Integrates patient records, treatment plans, medications, and appointments into a single platform.
Real-time Monitoring & Analytics: Provides insights into treatment efficacy through comprehensive analytics.
Data Visualization: Visualizes patient data using RStudio for healthcare providers to make data-driven decisions.
Robust Data Management: Implements relational and non-relational database solutions to handle diverse data types and ensure scalability.
Synthetic Data Generation: Uses Pythonâ€™s Faker library to generate realistic datasets for testing.
# Technologies Used
Database Management:
MySQL: Relational database used to implement the conceptual data model, ensuring structured data storage for cancer patient records, treatment plans, and healthcare providers.
MongoDB: NoSQL database used for scalability and flexible data representation, implemented via Studio 3T.
Programming & Data Generation:
Python: Utilized to generate synthetic datasets using the Faker library, and for running analytical queries.
Data Visualization & Analysis:
RStudio: Used to visualize cancer patient data, including cancer type prevalence, treatment outcomes, and healthcare provider performance.
ggplot2: Visualization library in R for plotting detailed visual representations of the data.
